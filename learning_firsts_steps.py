# This code has the purpose of teaching the first steps  #
# to use Git and GitHub. For that reason, we are going   #
# to create a function. This one will be short,          #
# because this is a test to practice the meaning of      #
# git push, fetch, and pull. These are very important    #
# because they are key to collaborating effectively.     #

    This function aims to encourage collaboration and practice
    how to add or modify features in the function. For this 
    reason, we will work on adding a new feature to this 
    function, which is related to 'Fibonacci'. It doesn’t 
    matter if you don’t know how to solve this problem; 
    this is just practice for Git, so it's okay.
